# Airtable Table Schema: Products

This document outlines the schema for the `Products` table in Airtable. This table is designed to list all products offered by farmers, including details like name, category, price, quantity, and links to the farmer and relevant certifications.

## Fields:

1.  **`ProductID`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Autonumber` (Primary Key - Airtable's equivalent for a unique, auto-incrementing ID. While UUID is ideal, Autonumber is a practical choice within Airtable if direct UUID generation isn't a primary field type.)
    *   **Description**: Unique identifier for each product listing.

2.  **`FarmerID`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Link to Another Record`
    *   **Linked Table**: `Users` (It's advisable to configure the link to filter or suggest records where the `Role` field in the `Users` table is "Farmer", if Airtable's linking features allow for such view/filter configurations on linked record selection.)
    *   **Description**: Links to the farmer (from the `Users` table) who listed this product.

3.  **`ProductName`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Single Line Text`
    *   **Description**: Name of the product (e.g., "Organic Kale", "Honeycrisp Apples").

4.  **`Category`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Single Select` (Consider `Multiple Select` if products can genuinely belong to multiple distinct categories, though `Single Select` is often cleaner for initial filtering.)
    *   **Options**: "Vegetable", "Fruit", "Dairy", "Grains", "Meats", "Other" (These are example options and can be expanded based on the variety of products offered.)
    *   **Description**: Product category, primarily used for filtering and searching functionalities.

5.  **`Description`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Long Text`
    *   **Description**: Detailed description of the product, which can include information about its qualities, the farming practices used, and any other relevant details.

6.  **`Price`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Currency` (This type is specifically designed for monetary values and typically allows specifying the currency symbol, e.g., USD, EUR.)
    *   **Description**: Price per unit of the product.

7.  **`Unit`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Single Select`
    *   **Options**: "kg", "lbs", "bunch", "piece", "dozen", "gallon", "liter" (These options should be standardized and expanded as needed.)
    *   **Description**: The unit of measurement that corresponds to the `Price` and `QuantityAvailable` (e.g., if Price is $5 and Unit is "kg", it means $5 per kilogram).

8.  **`QuantityAvailable`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Number` (Set to Integer format)
    *   **Description**: Current stock quantity available for this product. This field will need to be dynamically updated as orders are placed or when the farmer updates their inventory.

9.  **`HarvestDate`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Date`
    *   **Description**: The date when the product was harvested. For products not yet harvested, this could represent the expected harvest date.

10. **`ProductImageURLs`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Attachment` (Airtable's `Attachment` field type is recommended as it can store multiple image files directly within the record and is generally better for integration with front-end platforms like Glide or Adalo for displaying images.)
    *   **Description**: Contains one or more images of the product.

11. **`Certifications`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Link to Another Record`
    *   **Linked Table**: `Certifications`
    *   **Description**: Links to relevant certifications (from the `Certifications` table) that apply to this specific product. Some certifications might be farmer-level (linked in the `Users` table), while others are product-specific.

12. **`ListingStatus`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Single Select`
    *   **Options**: "Active", "Inactive", "Sold Out"
    *   **Description**: Indicates the current status of the product listing, which helps in managing visibility and availability to customers.

13. **`DateAdded`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Created Time`
    *   **Description**: Timestamp automatically generated by Airtable when the product record is first created, indicating when it was added to the system.

14. **`LastUpdated`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Last Modified Time`
    *   **Description**: Timestamp automatically updated by Airtable whenever any field in the product record is modified, indicating the last time the listing was updated.
