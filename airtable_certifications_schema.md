# Airtable Table Schema: Certifications

This document outlines the schema for the `Certifications` table in Airtable. This table is designed to store details of certifications uploaded by farmers (e.g., USDA Organic).

## Fields:

1.  **`CertificationID`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Autonumber` (While `UUID` is ideal for globally unique IDs, Airtable's `Autonumber` serves as a practical primary key, automatically generating a unique, incrementing number for each record.)
    *   **Description**: Unique identifier for each certification record.

2.  **`FarmerID`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Link to Another Record`
    *   **Linked Table**: `Users` (It is recommended to configure the link to only show records where the `Role` field in the `Users` table is "Farmer" to ensure data integrity and ease of selection.)
    *   **Description**: Links to the farmer (from the `Users` table) who holds this certification.

3.  **`CertificationName`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Single Line Text`
    *   **Description**: Name of the certification (e.g., "USDA Organic", "Fair Trade Certified").

4.  **`IssuingBody`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Single Line Text`
    *   **Description**: Organization or authority that issued the certification (e.g., "CCOF", "Fair Trade USA").

5.  **`CertificationNumber`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Single Line Text`
    *   **Description**: Official number or identifier on the certificate, if applicable.

6.  **`ValidFrom`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Date`
    *   **Description**: Date from which the certification is valid.

7.  **`ValidTo`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Date`
    *   **Description**: Expiration date of the certification.

8.  **`CertificationDocument`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Attachment`
    *   **Description**: The scanned copy or official PDF/image file of the certification. Multiple files can be attached if needed (e.g., front and back of a document).

9.  **`VerificationStatus`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Single Select`
    *   **Options**: "Pending", "Verified", "Expired", "Rejected"
    *   **Description**: Status of the certification's verification by the platform admin or salesman. This helps in managing the authenticity and current validity of the certifications.

10. **`DateAdded`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Created Time`
    *   **Description**: Timestamp automatically generated by Airtable when the certification record is first created.

11. **`LastUpdated`**:
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Last Modified Time`
    *   **Description**: Timestamp automatically updated by Airtable whenever any field in the certification record is modified.

12. **`ProductsLinked`**: (Optional convenience field)
    *   **Airtable Type**: `Link to Another Record` (This field will be a lookup or rollup based on the link from the `Products` table.)
    *   **Linked Table**: `Products`
    *   **Description**: Shows which products are associated with this certification. This serves as a reverse link from the `Products.Certifications` field, providing a quick overview of product associations from the certification's perspective. This field is often automatically managed by Airtable when a two-way link is established.
